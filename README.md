Withdrawal Management System
This Java program simulates a basic withdrawal management system for bank accounts. The program allows a user to input their current balance and the amount they wish to withdraw, and then it processes the transaction based on predefined rules.

Features
Check for Sufficient Funds: Ensures that the user has enough balance to cover the withdrawal amount.
Daily Withdrawal Limit: Validates that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the daily limit.
Charge Application: Applies a 2% charge if the remaining balance after the withdrawal falls below a certain threshold.
How to Use

Input:

Current Balance: Enter the current balance of the account.

Output:

Transaction Status: The program will output whether the transaction was successful or if there were issues such as insufficient funds or exceeding the daily limit.
